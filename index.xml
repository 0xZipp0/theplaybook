      <description>Greetings! I&amp;rsquo;m Yusuf, a passionate full-time learner and a vulnerability analyst. My mission? Strengthening attack surfaces that could potentially wreak havoc. My deep-rooted fascination lies in Information Technology, specifically in fortifying systems against unwarranted intrusion by hackers. To deepen my expertise in this realm, I actively pursued the study of cyber security alongside my formal education. Furthermore, I was fortunate enough to become a part of Surabaya Hacker Link, an esteemed non-profit community that exposed me to invaluable insights and broadened my understanding of cutting-edge security practices.</description>

      <title>Fixing gaps around terminal windows Burpsuite</title>
      <link>https://0xZipp0.github.io/theplaybook/docs/fix-screen-jar/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If there are empty gaps of desktop space outside terminal windows, it is likely due to the terminal&amp;rsquo;s font size. Either adjust the size until finding the ideal scale that closes the gap, or toggle resizehints to 0 in config.h.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will cause dwm to ignore resize requests from all client windows, not just terminals. The downside to this workaround is that some terminals may suffer redraw anomalies, such as ghost lines and premature line wraps, among others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamic Window Manager (Suckless)</title>
      <link>https://0xZipp0.github.io/theplaybook/docs/dwm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The suckless developers created DWM, which stands for dynamic window manager. Itâ€™s a tiling window manager with a minimalist design. It takes less than 500MB of RAM and only a few processes when it first starts up. First and foremost, there is only one correct way to install dwm and other Suckless tools: from source (either straight from suckless.org).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
